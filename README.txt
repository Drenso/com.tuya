Connect any Tuya device with Homey & Homey Pro.

INSTRUCTIONS
Before you can connect your Tuya device to Homey, please ensure that it's connected to the 'Smart Life' app for iOS or Android.

If you currently use one or more other Tuya-based apps, you can easily re-connect your devices by resetting them and connecting them from the Smart Life app.

CONTRIBUTE
Tuya makes many devices, and we're working together with the Homey Community to add support for all of them. If you'd like to contribute, visit the source on GitHub.
