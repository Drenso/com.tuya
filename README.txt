Connect any Tuya device with Homey & Homey Pro.

INSTRUCTIONS
Before you can connect your Tuya device to Homey, ensure that it's connected to the 'Tuya Smart' or 'Smart Life' app for iOS/Android.

If you currently use another Tuya-based app for your device, you should reset your device, and then connect it to the 'Tuya Smart' or 'Smart Life' app.

CONTRIBUTE
Tuya makes many devices, and we're working together with the Homey Community to add support for all of them. If you'd like to contribute, visit the source on GitHub.
